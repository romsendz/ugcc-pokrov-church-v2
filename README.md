# ugcc-pokrov-v2

A full-stack web application rebuilt for the UGCC Church in my lovely hometown.

This is a complete rewrite of the original project with a new design and improved performance. 

Designed to provide a modern, user-friendly platform for the local community to access church-related information. 

Features a CMS-like structure allowing authenticated admins to update content dynamically. 

Implements NextAuth with credential-based authentication for secure admin access. Fully responsive design ensures accessibility across all devices.

The goal is to strengthen the connection between the church and the community by providing a centralized hub for updates and resources.
